# Excel-Data-analysis-project-uno
This project explores **retail sales performance and customer purchasing behavior** using an Excel-based dataset.   The goal is to uncover insights about how age, gender, product preferences, and time-based trends influence consumer behavior and overall sales performance.  
As an **aspiring data analyst**, I used this project to demonstrate my ability to clean, analyze, and visualize data using Microsoft Excel, focusing on real-world retail insights that can support marketing, sales, and business strategy decisions.
## Objectives
The analysis aimed to answer the following key questions:

- How do **customer age and gender** influence purchasing behavior?  
- Are there **discernible patterns in sales** across different time periods?  
- Which **product categories** hold the highest appeal among customers?  
- What are the **relationships between age, spending, and product preferences**?  
- How do customers **adapt their shopping habits** during seasonal trends?  
- Are there **distinct purchasing behaviors** based on the number of items bought per transaction?  
- What insights can be gleaned from the **distribution of product prices** within each category?

##  Dataset Description
The dataset contains detailed records of retail transactions, including customer demographics, purchase details, and product information.
